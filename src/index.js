// Quiz

// 1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
// React is what defines JSX

// 2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
// A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
// eventually add to the real DOM for us.

// 3. What's wrong with this code:
// ```
// const page = (
//     <h1>Hello</h1>
//     <p>This is my website!</p>
// )
// ```
// We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element

// 4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
// Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
// and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
// to tell it HOW to do each step.

// 5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
// We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
// larger/greater than the individual pieces.
